# Making Rest API with Deno and TypeScript

I made simple post [how to write simple API based on Deno](https://jakeroid.com/blog/making-rest-api-with-deno-and-typescript/) in my blog.
This code is related to that article.
I hope someone, especially newbies, could find it usefully in learning.

If you need some assistance or similar software, I could help.
